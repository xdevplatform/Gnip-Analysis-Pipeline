# Testing and development

Before submitting a pull request on bug fixes or new features, be sure to run the tests here in the test suite. Follow the steps below (example code follows):

- create an empty, isolated Python 2.7.11 environment 
- navigate to the repository root (``Gnip-Analysis-Pipeline``) and install the local version of the library. Use the ``-U`` flag to be sure that any pre-existing version is uninstalled and a fresh version is installed 
- navigate to the ``tests/`` directory and run the test suite
- fix any errors from failed tests
- if you discover a new edge case, add it as a new test method where ever seems most appropriate

An example of how to install the library for development and testing:

```bash
jmontague@data-science-4:~ 
$ mkvirtualenv -p /opt/bin/python2.7 dev-env

(dev-env) jmontague@data-science-4:~ 
$ cd Gnip-Analysis-Pipeline/

(dev-env) jmontague@data-science-4:~/Gnip-Analysis-Pipeline [tests]
$ pip install . -U  # installs (and upgrades) all the dependencies
(dev-env) jmontague@data-science-4:~/Gnip-Analysis-Pipeline [tests]
$ cd tests/

(dev-env) jmontague@data-science-4:~/Gnip-Analysis-Pipeline/tests [tests]
$ python tweet_evaluation_tests.py 
....................

Ran 20 tests in 6.024s

OK
```

If any of the tests fail, it's useful to use a second session (window) to edit the code and address the failing test. Then, when you're ready, you can hop back to the first session and run the reinstall (and upgrade) and tests all at once: 

```
(dev-env) jmontague@data-science-4:~/Gnip-Analysis-Pipeline/tests [tests]
$ cd ..; pip install . -U; cd -; python tweet_evaluation_tests.py
